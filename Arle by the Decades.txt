<time>1990's</time> Bounced between Maryland, New Mexico, and California while learning Non-Profit Management working with the Peace Corps, Homeless Shelters, and Elder Care. Figured out how to build and repair a series of ad hoc computer networks.  Learned what the inside of a CRT looked like I also acquired a lovely wife and darling daughter.

      <div>
<time>2000's</time> Split my time between poverty prevention programs, student loan collections, and child abuse prevention. Learned the joy and pain of computer virus management, figured out how to keep a variety of aged hardware running, and became the guy to ask about that IT stuff. Acquired a handsome son.

      <div>
<time>2010's</time> Went into the schools, first as a social worker, then a building technologist, and finally as a special education teacher.  Butted head with Databases gone rogue, students and staff abusing software, hardware and content filters, mixed wired and wireless networks running whatever hardware and software was deemed affordable.  Kept a motley collection of Microsoft and Apple laptops, Chromebooks, Chromeboxes, Ipads and Androids running despite the abuse of technophobes and students.  Taught low income special education students reading,  geometry, physics, biology, US history, world history, economics, psychology,and glass blowing. Walked away from the classroom in April of 2018 to focus on all thing technological and all people autistic.
